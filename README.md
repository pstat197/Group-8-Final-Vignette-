# Vignette Abstract
For our topic we are specializing on three different types of clustering methods. But first let's look at what clustering is. Clustering refers to partitioning our observations from our data set into distinct groups that are similar to each other. In hierarchical clustering the main principle is that every object is connected to its neighbors depending on their distance.It is represented in a dendrogram which is an upside down tree. In density based clustering or model based methods the data is clustered based on density and not distance like in the hierarchical method. Lastly we decided to also use distribution based clustering method. This method uses an entirely different metric, probability. In this method the data is grouped based on the likelihood of belonging to the same probability distribution. We decided to utilize an unsupervised country classification data set where we implemented hierarchical clustering, density and distributional based clustering. We found that using 3 clusters in our hierarchical method provided the best results.
